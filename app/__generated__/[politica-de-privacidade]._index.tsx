You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize your ads on the Google Ad Settings."}

{""}
<br />
{"6. Responsibility for Features and Updates"}
<br />
{""}

{"If WhatsApp modifies its website, partially or completely, it is possible that some or all of Klivio's features may stop working. While we strive to update the extension, we cannot guarantee its perpetual functionality. As per item 5, no refunds will be issued if the tool becomes obsolete due to these changes."}

{"7. Use of the Bulk Message Feature"}
<br />
{""}
<br />
{"The bulk sending function was created to optimize communication by sending the same message to multiple contacts efficiently."}

The risk of losing your number when using this feature is high and is entirely your responsibility. Klivio offers no guarantee for this function and is not liable for any account banning or loss. By accepting these terms, you confirm that you have been warned of the risk and assume full responsibility."}
